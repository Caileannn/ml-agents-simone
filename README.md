# ML-Agents Experiments ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

This repository is for *experimenting* with ML Agents & Unity.

## Requirements

You can follow the setup instructions for Windows [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/develop/docs/Installation.md). I would recommend goign through the **advanced local installtion** for development. This project also requires the experimental build of MLAgents which can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@2.3/manual/index.html).

## Documentation

### _Multiple Brain: Reading & Setting Models during runtime from a local directory_
You can find this method in `SwapModel.cs`. 
### _Extracting & Displaying trainging information_
![c_Monitor](https://github.com/Caileannn/ml-agents-simone/assets/25906839/06d45f96-3425-4daa-9fcf-52756017f5c8)

By using the `Monitor.cs` script, you can easily display information about the agent. I also added a display for the swapping of the models within a local directory.
