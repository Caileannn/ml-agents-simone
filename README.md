# ML-Agents Experiments ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

This repository is for *experimenting* with ML Agents & Unity.

## Requirements

You can follow the setup instructions for Windows [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/develop/docs/Installation.md). I would recommend goign through the **advanced local installtion** for development. This project also requires the experimental build of MLAgents which can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@2.3/manual/index.html).
